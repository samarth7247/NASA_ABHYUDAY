NASA Space Hackathon – Smart Urban Planning WebApp
Problem Statement

Climate change brings new challenges in maintaining the well-being of society and the environment in urban areas. Natural resources, ecosystems, and existing infrastructure must be continuously monitored to ensure a sustainable quality of life.

Challenge:
Demonstrate how an urban planner can use NASA Earth Observation Data to develop smart strategies for city growth that balance human well-being and environmental sustainability.

Our Solution

We are developing a web application that empowers builders, government bodies, and property buyers to make data-driven urban planning decisions.

Our system utilizes NASA Earth Observation Data to highlight key environmental indicators like:

Land Surface Temperature

Vegetation Index (NDVI)

Air and Water Quality Metrics

Climate Trends and Anomalies

Based on this, the platform provides strategic AI-driven suggestions for urban construction that prioritize sustainability and livability.

Action Users
1. Builders / Urban Planners

Builders and developers can:

Create accounts and explore environmental conditions of different regions using real-time NASA data.

Save potential locations with latitude–longitude data.

Design sustainable urban projects through an integrated 3D planning tool.

Receive AI-based recommendations for eco-friendly designs.

Save and track projects via an interactive dashboard.

2. Property Buyers

Buyers can:

Explore properties with real-time livability and sustainability scores.

View ongoing sustainable projects from verified builders.

Save locations and properties of interest.

Connect directly with builders for purchasing or investment.

3. Government Bodies

Authorities can:

Review project progress and sustainability reports of builders.

Upload and manage government-owned lands available for tender.

Track builder performance and assign projects based on reputation and environmental compliance.

4. Admin

Admins manage:

Authorized NASA API data integration.

User authentication and activity tracking.

Monitoring of active projects and registered users.

System-level maintenance and analytics.
